# Covid19_Cough_classification
### I have tried using: (1) public_dataset from [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11644.pdf) and downloading [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4048312?fbclid=IwAR1XYUC78kSbFTa9T1C-EekPSdFx8llyKQ_fjQLJO0YNi8LdPvjN-xCQi1Y#.YNRsrZozZNi); and (2) Coswara from India [dataset](https://github.com/iiscleap/Coswara-Data).
### If you want to know more detail about Explore Data Analysis of these datasets, please see our repository [here](https://github.com/covid19-detection/data_collection).
### Then, I convert these datasets from *wav to MelSpectrograms following MFCC and STFT algorithms using [notebook](https://github.com/linhduongtuan/Covid19_Cough_classification/blob/main/FILE_20210604_175327_cough_covid-1.ipynb).
### I have performed various experiments and achieved the best results in Coswara dataset. Please refer my [notebook](https://github.com/linhduongtuan/Covid19_Cough_classification/blob/main/Inference.ipynb)
### However, I have been not satisfy my prediction performance due to big questions about design of experiment to collect such data. I am not convinced to the claim of paper from MIT [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9208795) too.
